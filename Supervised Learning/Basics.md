# Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

## **Artificial Intelligence**
To create an application which can perform its own task without any human intervention.  
**Example:** Netflix Recommendation Systems  

## **Machine Learning**
ML is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It provides statistical tools to analyze, visualize, predict, and forecast data.  

## **Deep Learning**
A subset of ML that mimics the human brain's neural networks for decision-making and pattern recognition.

## **Types of ML Techniques**

### **Supervised ML**
In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, where both input features and corresponding output labels are provided. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs.  

**Types:**  
- **Regression:** The Output (or) Dependent features will be Continuous  
- **Classification:** The Output (or) Dependent features will be Categorical  
    - **Two Categories:** Binary Classification  
    - **More than two Categories:** Multi-class Classification  

**Algorithms:**  
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge and Lasso  
- ElasticNet  
- Logistic Regression (Classification)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- AdaBoost  
- XGBoost  

*(The above four algorithms solve both classification and regression problems.)*  

### **Unsupervised ML**
In unsupervised learning, models are trained using unlabeled data, where only the input features are provided. The model identifies patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.  

**Algorithms:**  
**Clustering:**  
- KMeans  
- Hierarchical Mean  
- DBScan  

### **Reinforcement Learning**
In reinforcement learning, agents learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.

## **Instance-Based Learning**
Instance-based learning occurs when the system learns the examples by heart and generalizes new cases using a similarity measure to compare them to learned examples (or a subset of them).  
#  Memorize the data
**Example:** The new instance would be classified as a triangle because the majority of the most similar instances belong to that class.  

## **Model-Based Learning**
Another way to generalize from a set of examples is to build a model of these examples and then use that model to make predictions. This is called **model-based learning**. 
# Learn the pattern of the data
